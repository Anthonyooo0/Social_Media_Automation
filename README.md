## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/social-media-analytics.git
cd social-media-analytics
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the application**
```bash
python app.py
```

4. **Open your browser**
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 📖 Usage

1. Select platform (Reddit currently supported)
2. Enter subreddit name (without "r/")
   - Examples: `python`, `datascience`, `technology`
3. Choose number of posts to analyze (50-200)
4. Click **Analyze**
5. View results:
   - Overall statistics
   - Hourly post distribution chart
   - Top trending words
   - Most popular posts with scores

## 🗄️ Database

The app uses SQLite to store:
- All fetched posts
- Analysis history
- Cached results

Database file: `analytics.db`

## 📊 What Gets Analyzed

### Reddit Analysis
- **Post metrics**: Score (upvotes), comments, author
- **Timing**: When posts are made (hourly distribution)
- **Content**: Word frequency in titles and text
- **Trends**: Top performing posts
- **Engagement**: Average scores and comment counts

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Data**: PRAW (Reddit API), SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Visualizations**: Chart.js
- **Analysis**: Python collections, regex

## 🔑 API Configuration

Currently uses PRAW in **read-only mode** (no authentication needed).

For higher rate limits, add Reddit API credentials:

1. Create app at: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Update `app.py`:
```python
reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
    user_agent='Social Media Analytics v1.0'
)
```
